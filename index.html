Electronic Health Records (EHR) patient portals have the potential to significantly improve healthcare by enabling patients to access their medical information, communicate effectively with healthcare providers, and actively participate in their health management. However, the adoption of EHR systems in China remains limited, presenting a critical gap that affects patient care and healthcare efficiency.
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
Motivated by personal observations during hospital visits in Chengdu, I noticed significant usability issues with existing EHR interfaces, particularly impacting elderly patients who struggled with complex navigation and inadequate support. Recognizing the broader implications of these barriers, I embarked on a structured investigation into the acceptance and usability of EHR systems from the perspective of healthcare consumers in China.
</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
Key concepts such as usability, technology acceptance, and patient engagement guided my approach. Specifically, I employed the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 3 (UTAUT3), a comprehensive theoretical model designed to evaluate technology adoption by examining user expectations, ease of use, social influence, facilitating conditions, habits, personal innovativeness, and health consciousness.
</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
The research methods involved participatory observations, focus group discussions, and a comprehensive nationwide survey. Initially, focus groups informed the identification of critical barriers including user navigation challenges, trust issues, and data privacy concerns. Subsequently, a carefully structured survey based on UTAUT3 principles gathered responses from over 1,300 participants across China, providing robust data on key factors influencing user acceptance.
</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
    The findings from this systematic approach highlighted several critical themes influencing EHR adoption:
</p>   
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">

    1.Performance Expectancy: Users are significantly more likely to adopt systems perceived to offer clear health benefits.
    
    2.Effort Expectancy: Systems must be intuitive and easy to navigate to enhance adoption.
    
    3.Social Influence: Recommendations and experiences shared by peers significantly impact user intentions.
    
    4.Facilitating Conditions: Availability of adequate resources and support substantially affects user adoption.
    
    5.Habit and Health Consciousness: Users' regular technology use patterns and awareness of personal health management strongly influence their engagement with EHR systems.
</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
Guided by these insights, my team and I collaborated with engineering students to develop an innovative EHR portal tailored specifically for Chinese users. A notable enhancement included integrating an AI-powered assistant designed to guide users effortlessly through various features, significantly improving accessibility and user satisfaction.
</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
To rigorously evaluate the enhanced system, we conducted controlled experiments utilizing eye-tracking and EEG technologies, enabling us to objectively assess cognitive and emotional responses and iteratively refine the platform based on these insights.
</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
This project makes significant practical contributions by highlighting specific user-driven improvements necessary for successful EHR implementation in China. It also provides clear guidance for future developments, emphasizing the need for ongoing research to refine user interfaces and ensure that patient-centered technologies align with the unique social and cultural dynamics of Chinese healthcare consumers.

    As societies age, mental health challenges among older adults, such as depression, social isolation, and declining self-identity, have become increasingly prevalent. In Hong Kong, these issues are particularly critical due to a rapidly aging population. Responding to this pressing need, our research at the Chinese University of Hong Kong explores an innovative intervention combining narrative therapy and personalized digital memory services to enhance psychological well-being among older individuals.
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
    Narrative therapy is a therapeutic approach that empowers individuals by enabling them to reconstruct meaningful personal narratives. Complementing this, digital storytelling utilizes multimedia elements—text, images, audio, and video—to help older adults actively engage with and preserve their life stories digitally. By integrating these two approaches, our intervention addresses depression and social isolation by strengthening older adults' sense of identity and social connectedness.
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
    The methodological framework employed a repeated-measures experimental design involving 30 to 50 older adults experiencing mild to moderate depressive symptoms. Participants engaged in structured narrative therapy sessions, which encouraged reflective personal storytelling. Subsequently, these narratives were transformed into personalized digital memory profiles in the form of interactive websites. The intervention concluded with participants sharing these digital narratives with their social networks, fostering deeper interpersonal connections and promoting emotional support.

    The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly tested the resilience of healthcare systems globally, creating significant shortages in critical medical resources such as hospital beds, ventilators, and healthcare personnel. These shortages have compelled hospitals to prioritize COVID-19 patients, often leading to delays and inadequate care for other urgent and chronic conditions. Recognizing these severe challenges, I collaborated with West China Hospital to explore advanced solutions aimed at optimizing resource allocation and patient admission processes during pandemic crises using Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Deep Q-Networks (DQN).
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
    Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a powerful machine learning technique that trains models to make optimal decisions through interaction with their environment, learning from outcomes to improve future decision-making. Deep Q-Networks (DQN), an advanced form of RL, combine traditional reinforcement learning with deep neural networks to effectively manage complex and dynamic situations, such as allocating limited healthcare resources.
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
    Our research utilized West China Hospital, a prominent medical center, as the setting for this study. Faced with resource limitations and rapidly changing conditions during the COVID-19 Omicron variant surge, the hospital urgently needed a dynamic and efficient admission and resource allocation protocol. We developed a model based on DQN, which aimed to dynamically allocate inpatient beds among different patient categories: outpatients, emergency patients, and COVID-19 pneumonia patients.

    In today's rapidly evolving digital environment, online video platforms have become crucial for advertising, yet many pop-up ads are perceived negatively due to their intrusive nature. This raises critical questions for advertisers: How can pop-up ads be designed effectively to attract viewers' attention without disrupting their viewing experience? Recognizing this challenge, my research aims to understand how video pace, ad relevance, and color influence viewer attention and overall impressions of pop-up advertisements on video platforms.
</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
    Theoretically, this study builds upon the Limited Capacity Model, which suggests that consumers have limited cognitive resources and can become overloaded when presented with excessive information simultaneously. Additionally, Cognitive Load Theory further classifies these demands into intrinsic (task complexity), extraneous (presentation style), and germane (content relevance), providing a structured lens to assess how different ad features interact with viewer attention and perception.
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
    A carefully controlled experimental approach was employed, integrating eye-tracking technology to objectively measure viewer attention and fixation durations alongside questionnaires capturing subjective impressions. Participants viewed videos manipulated for pace (fast or slow) accompanied by pop-up ads varying in relevance (high or low) and color vividness (bright or dull). These variables were systematically combined to form different viewing conditions, with each participant exposed to all conditions in randomized order to ensure experimental rigor and minimize biases.
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
    Results from the eye-tracking data indicated a significant interaction between video pace and ad relevance. Specifically, high-relevance pop-up ads attracted more sustained attention when embedded in slower-paced videos, as viewers had more cognitive resources available to process the congruent ad content deeply. Interestingly, under faster video pace conditions, the relevance of ads did not significantly impact viewer attention, suggesting that the increased cognitive load associated with faster-paced videos reduces viewers' ability to engage deeply with the ads, regardless of their relevance.
</p>   
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
    Further analysis revealed a nuanced role for ad color. Bright colors significantly enhanced viewer attention when ads were highly relevant and appeared in slower-paced videos. Conversely, brightly colored ads with low relevance in the same context led to reduced attention, possibly because they exacerbated cognitive conflicts or irritation. These findings indicate that visual salience through color must be strategically matched with ad relevance to optimize viewer attention.
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
    Regarding viewer impressions, ad relevance emerged as the most critical factor, significantly influencing subjective impressions irrespective of video pace. Ads that were closely related to video content consistently elicited more positive viewer responses, underscoring the importance of contextual congruence. Notably, bright colors negatively impacted impressions when ads were of low relevance, likely due to perceived intrusiveness or disruption.
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
    The practical implications of this research are substantial, offering clear strategies for advertisers. To effectively capture viewer attention and leave positive impressions, advertisers should embed brightly colored, contextually relevant pop-up ads within slower-paced video segments. Conversely, in contexts where relevance is low, dull-colored ads are preferable to minimize cognitive disruption and improve overall viewer perception.
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
    This study contributes significantly to both theory and practice by clarifying how cognitive load and visual design features jointly influence advertising effectiveness. Future research directions include exploring deeper cognitive mechanisms behind viewer engagement and extending the investigation into how ad effectiveness translates into actual consumer behaviors such as clicks and purchases.

    With the explosive growth of short-form video platforms like TikTok, augmented reality (AR) filters have become a crucial feature to capture user attention and foster interaction. However, despite their popularity, there remains limited scholarly understanding of how specific characteristics of AR filters—namely virtuality and exaggeration—impact viewer interaction. Addressing this gap is essential for social media marketers and developers aiming to enhance user engagement and improve content effectiveness on these platforms.
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
    In this study, we define key concepts clearly and accessibly: virtuality refers to the extent to which digital enhancements convincingly blend with reality, creating immersive experiences, while exaggeration refers to visual alterations that dramatically emphasize or diminish certain features, increasing entertainment value and curiosity. These elements are central to understanding the AR experience on TikTok, where visual appeal directly influences viewer interaction.
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
    To investigate these effects, we systematically analyzed viewer interactions with 823 popular TikTok videos employing official AR filters. Each filter's level of virtuality and exaggeration was quantitatively assessed through viewer surveys, creating a robust foundation for empirical analysis. Interaction was measured using publicly available data, such as the number of likes and favorites.
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
    The findings were clearly structured and revealed several important insights:
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
    Both virtuality and exaggeration independently demonstrated a strong positive correlation with viewer interaction. Higher virtuality significantly increased viewer engagement, suggesting that more immersive and realistic AR experiences foster deeper viewer engagement.
</p>   
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
    Similarly, filters with a higher degree of exaggeration were more effective at attracting viewer attention, confirming the critical role of playful and visually striking content.
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
    However, the interaction between virtuality and exaggeration presented a more nuanced scenario. Our analysis revealed an inverse relationship when both virtuality and exaggeration were high, suggesting a saturation effect. Excessive simultaneous increases in both dimensions might overwhelm viewers, thus reducing overall interaction.
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
    This study makes important theoretical contributions by clarifying the complex relationship between AR filter characteristics and viewer behavior. While past research provided inconsistent views regarding AR virtuality, our findings clearly indicate that moderate, rather than extreme, virtuality optimally enhances viewer interaction. Moreover, the identification of a significant, albeit negative, interaction between virtuality and exaggeration adds depth to existing theories, highlighting the need for balanced design approaches in AR filter creation.
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
    Practically, this research provides actionable insights for social media platforms and marketers. To optimize viewer interaction, creators should carefully balance virtuality and exaggeration. Specifically, moderate virtuality combined with high exaggeration appears ideal for maximizing viewer engagement, avoiding excessive cognitive overload. This recommendation provides direct strategic value for developers seeking to refine AR filters to achieve maximum user impact and interaction.
</p> 
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
    Future research should extend this analysis beyond TikTok to other platforms, explore underlying cognitive mechanisms through additional physiological measurements, and investigate the long-term implications of AR filter usage on viewer behavior and well-being. This broader understanding will not only contribute academically but also guide practical improvements in AR filter design, ultimately enhancing viewer experiences and engagement on social media platforms.
